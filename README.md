# horseshit

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/horseshit.png)](http://badge.fury.io/py/horseshit)

__horseshit__ is an easy-to-use command line program that blocks websites known to distract us from our work, which is forked from [leftnode/get-shit-done](https://github.com/leftnode/get-shit-done).

Available in Python 2.x/3.x, horseshit is also a PyPI package that can be easily installed and updated via `pip`.

Project homepage: <http://www.soimort.org/horseshit>

## Installation

### 1. Using the PyPI package:

Install the PyPI package:

    $ [sudo] pip install horseshit

or:

    $ [sudo] easy_install horseshit

### 2. Using Git:

Clone the Git repository:

    $ git clone git://github.com/soimort/horseshit.git
    $ [sudo] python setup.py install

## Usage

### 1. Configuration

`horseshits` is a no-brainer plain text file contains a load of horseshits that may distract you from work, line by line.

    twitter.com
    plus.google.com
    reddit.com

On *nix systems, put your `horseshits` into:

    /etc/horseshits

Or: (recommended!)

    ~/.config/horseshits

On Windows, put it into your user directory:

    .config/horseshits

### 2. To get-shit-done

Execute it as root because it modifies your hosts file and restarts your network daemon.

    $ sudo get-shit-done work

### 3. To no longer get-shit-done

    $ sudo get-shit-done play

## Additional Tips

You can, of course, use `get-shit-done` with your `crontab`, to control your work time and play time during the day. Whatever, I should say self-control is always the best.
