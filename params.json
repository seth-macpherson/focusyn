{"body":"# horseshit\r\n\r\n__horseshit__ is an easy-to-use command line program that blocks websites known to distract us from our work, which is forked from [leftnode/get-shit-done](https://github.com/leftnode/get-shit-done).\r\n\r\nUnlike __get-shit-done__, __horseshit__ is implemented in Python only, with both 2.x/3.x compatibility. __horseshit__ is also a PyPI package, so that it can be installed and updated via `pip` or `easy_install`.\r\n\r\nProject homepage: <http://www.soimort.org/horseshit>\r\n\r\nFork me on GitHub: <https://github.com/soimort/horseshit>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n### 1. Using the PyPI package:\r\n\r\nInstall the PyPI package:\r\n\r\n    $ pip install horseshit\r\n\r\nor:\r\n\r\n    $ easy_install horseshit\r\n\r\n### 2. Using Git:\r\n\r\nClone the Git repository:\r\n\r\n    $ git clone git://github.com/soimort/horseshit.git\r\n\r\nAfter cloning this repository, you may want to put it in your `$PATH` and ensure it is executable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n## 1. Setting horseshits\r\n\r\n`horseshits` is a no-brainer plain text file contains a load of horseshits that may distract you from work, line by line.\r\n\r\n    plus.google.com\r\n    twitter.com\r\n    reader.google.com\r\n    reddit.com\r\n\r\nAlso there is an example of what `horseshits` should be like in: `horseshits.example`.\r\n\r\nOn *nix systems, put your `horseshits` into:\r\n\r\n    /etc/horseshits\r\n\r\nYou can simply use the example I provided if you'd like:\r\n\r\n    sudo cp horseshits.example /etc/horseshits\r\n\r\nOr start writing your own:\r\n\r\n    sudo vi /etc/horseshits\r\n\r\nOn Windows, put it into your own user directory:\r\n\r\n    .config/horseshits\r\n\r\n## 2. To get-shit-done\r\n\r\nExecute `get-shit-done` as root because it modifies your hosts file and restarts your network daemon.\r\n\r\n    $ sudo get-shit-done work\r\n\r\n## 3. To no longer get-shit-done\r\n\r\n    $ sudo get-shit-done play\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Additional Tips\r\n\r\nYou can, of course, use `get-shit-done` with your `crontab`, to control your work time and play time during the day. Whatever, I should say self-control is always the best.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Acknowledgement\r\n\r\nThanks to Vic Cherubini, the original author of __get-shit-done__.\r\n\r\nThanks to myself. It finally comes to me that I have to stop my goddamned procrastination and increase focus NOW - for a proper work efficiency.\r\n\r\nShit kickin' productivity!\r\n","google":"","name":"Horseshit","note":"Don't delete this file!
