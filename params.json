Using the PyPI package:\r\n\r\nInstall the PyPI package:\r\n\r\n    $ [sudo] pip install horseshit\r\n\r\nor:\r\n\r\n    $ [sudo] easy_install horseshit\r\n\r\n### 2. Using Git:\r\n\r\nClone the Git repository:\r\n\r\n    $ git clone git://github.com/soimort/horseshit.git\r\n    $ [sudo] python setup.py install\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n### 1. Configuration\r\n\r\n`horseshits` is a no-brainer plain text file contains a load of horseshits that may distract you from work, line by line.\r\n\r\n    twitter.com\r\n    plus.google.com\r\n    reddit.com\r\n\r\nOn *nix systems, put your `horseshits` into:\r\n\r\n    /etc/horseshits\r\n\r\nOr: (recommended!)\r\n\r\n    ~/.config/horseshits\r\n\r\nOn Windows, put it into your user directory:\r\n\r\n    .config/horseshits\r\n\r\n### 2. To get-shit-done\r\n\r\nExecute it as root because it modifies your hosts file and restarts your network daemon.\r\n\r\n    $ sudo get-shit-done work\r\n\r\n### 3. To no longer get-shit-done\r\n\r\n    $ sudo get-shit-done play\r\n\r\n## Additional Tips\r\n\r\nYou can, of course, use `get-shit-done` with your `crontab`, to control your work time and play time during the day. Whatever, I should say self-control is always the best.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Acknowledgement\r\n\r\nThanks to Vic Cherubini, the original author of __get-shit-done__.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
